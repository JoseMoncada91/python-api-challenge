VacationPy and WeatherPy Projects by Jose Moncada (11/29/2024)
This project is split into two parts: VacationPy and WeatherPy. VacationPy focuses on finding ideal vacation spots based on temperature, while WeatherPy is about analyzing and visualizing weather data from cities around the world. Both parts involve using weather data to make informed decisions for planning trips or understanding global weather trends.

Overview
VacationPy
In the VacationPy part of the project, the goal was to find the best vacation destinations with the ideal temperature range of 20°C to 25°C. The process involved querying weather data for cities around the world and identifying those that fit the temperature criteria. These cities were then displayed on an interactive map, making it easy to visualize potential vacation spots.

A key part of this step was searching for hotels near these cities, which added extra value to the findings. I used the Geoapify API to gather hotel information, helping to provide a more complete view of each location. In Step 4, I used ChatGPT to support the search for hotels. The tool helped refine the search process by providing suggestions and best practices for handling API responses effectively. The map was built using Plotly, offering an interactive and engaging way to explore the results.

WeatherPy
For WeatherPy, I focused on analyzing weather patterns across multiple cities. The goal was to gather temperature data and analyze trends for different locations. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get up-to-date weather information for various cities. With this data, I plotted temperature trends to gain insights into the climates of different areas.

The project visualized the temperature data using Matplotlib, providing a clear view of how temperatures varied from city to city. This analysis helps to better understand global weather patterns.

Project Structure
VacationPy:

Data Collection: I used the Geoapify API to pull city weather data and find locations with temperatures in the desired range.
Hotel Search: Once I identified cities with the right weather, I added functionality to search for hotels near those cities, enhancing the vacation planning process.
Interactive Map: The results were visualized using Plotly to create an interactive map of the selected cities.
WeatherPy:

Data Collection: Weather data for cities was fetched using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Data Analysis: I analyzed the temperature data to identify trends and differences between cities.
Visualization: The temperature trends were displayed using Matplotlib, providing clear and informative charts.
Features
VacationPy:

City Search by Temperature: Finds cities that match the preferred temperature range for vacation planning.
Interactive Map: Shows selected cities on a map with weather details for each city.
Hotel Search: Provides information on hotels near selected cities, making it easier to plan vacations.
WeatherPy:

Weather Data Analysis: Collects temperature data for cities worldwide.
Temperature Visualization: Displays trends in temperature across multiple cities.
Insights into Global Weather: Helps to understand how weather varies in different regions.
Technologies Used
Python: Used as the main programming language for analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For handling and manipulating weather data.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations of temperature trends.
Plotly: To create interactive maps displaying vacation spots and weather data.
Requests: To make API calls to the weather and hotel services (Geoapify and OpenWeatherMap).
Geoapify API: Used to get hotel data and location-based information for vacation cities.
OpenWeatherMap API: Provides weather data for cities worldwide.
Conclusion
The VacationPy and WeatherPy projects were a great way to explore how we can use weather data to make informed decisions, whether it's planning a vacation or understanding global weather patterns. The work done here shows the power of data analysis and visualization in solving real-world problems like choosing the perfect vacation spot or analyzing global temperature trends.

In VacationPy, I used ChatGPT to assist in the hotel search process in Step 4. This helped improve the efficiency of querying hotel information and enhanced the overall user experience of the project. The weather analysis in WeatherPy provided valuable insights into the temperature trends across cities, while the Geoapify and OpenWeatherMap APIs made the data collection process seamless.

This project demonstrates the potential of combining data analysis with API integrations to create meaningful solutions.
